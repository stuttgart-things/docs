### /IDP

Why it is a good idea to build an **Internal Developer Platform Portal**:

- 🧩 **A centralized UI for developers**
- 🤖 **A self-service layer over infrastructure**
- 🚀🛡️ **A tool to accelerate delivery with guardrails**

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

> Think: “PaaS built by your platform team”

### 🚀 DORA Metrics

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics measure software delivery performance:

- **Deployment Frequency**
- **Lead Time for Changes**
- **Change Failure Rate**
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**

---

# 📈 IDPs Make DORA Metrics Actionable

| Metric | How an IDP Helps |
|--------|------------------|
| 📦 Deployment Frequency | Self-service deploys, GitOps integration |
| ⏱️ Lead Time for Changes | Track from commit → production |
| ❌ Change Failure Rate | Show failed rollouts, incident links |
| 🛠️ MTTR | Connect services to runbooks, SLOs, and ownership |

- 🛠️ Self-service deployment & environment provisioning
- 🔍 Visibility into logs, metrics, and deployments
- 🚦 Policy enforcement (e.g. security, cost, compliance)
- 📦 Template catalogs for fast onboarding

### 🚀 /Key IDP Benefits

➡️ **Developers Focus on Code, Not Infrastructure**

- ⚡️ **Focus on shipping features faster**
  → *"From idea to production in minutes, not days"*

- 🧠 **Focus purely on business logic**
  → *"No more YAML archaeology or cloud config headaches"*

- 🎓 **Self-service resources**
  *"Provision full dev environment with single click"*

- 🧩 **Clear ownership boundaries**
  → *"Devs own code, Platform owns infrastructure"*

---
### 📈 /Measuring Adoption

> Adoption shows whether developers trust, use, and benefit from the platform

- 🔁 **DAU/WAU/MAU**: Daily / Weekly / Monthly active users
- 🚀 **Self-service actions**: Number of created services, environments, deployments
- 🔍 **Time to First Deploy (TTFD)**: How fast a dev goes from repo to running app
- 💬 **Feedback loops**: Surveys, interviews, support tickets
