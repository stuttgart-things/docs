### 🚀 /WHY GITHUB IS USING PORT

> One platform to answer key operational questions:

- 📍 **Where is my service running?**
- 🔁 **Which services will be impacted by my features?**
- ⚠️ **Which SLOs are not being met by my team?**
- 👤 **Who owns a service?**
- 🧾 **Who made the last change in production?**

Port centralizes this data — giving teams **clarity, ownership, and impact awareness** across the software lifecycle.

---

### /GITHUB INTEGRATION


- 🧭 Build a catalog of services from GitHub repos automatically
- 🔁 Create golden paths that use GitHub Actions to scaffold new services


---

### 📦 /Central Source of Truth

- ✅ No more switching between tools
- 🗂️ Consolidated software catalog
- 🔗 Easy access to dependencies & metadata

---

### 📦 /Graph View

- provides an interactive, visual map of all your software catalog entities and their relationships.
- It's like a live architectural diagram — automatically generated from the catalog.

---

### /Core Concepts in Port

- **Blueprints**: Define schemas (e.g., service, environment)
- **Software Catalog**: Metadata-rich inventory of resources
- **Scorecards**: Maturity, reliability & security evaluations
- **Automations**: Self-service workflows triggered by events

---

### /Example: Create a New Service

- 🧩 Blueprint: `service`
-  🖥 Form: Choose language, repo, infra
- ⚙️ Automation: Scaffold code, set up CI, register in catalog

- 🎯 Developer gets a ready-to-use repo and pipeline in minutes

---
### /Tracking Developer Adoption

- ✔️ Service creation events
- ✔️ Workflow usage metrics
- ✔️ Scorecard completion
- ✔️ Catalog contribution

Use these to **measure value and improve platform fit**
