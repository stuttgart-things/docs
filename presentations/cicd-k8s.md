* Trunk-based development (TBD) is a source control workflow model that enables continuous integration <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
* The primary purpose of trunk-based development is to avoid the creation of long-lived branches by merging partial changes to the entire feature <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
--
* Developers can achieve this by committing straight to the main branch or by using short-lived branches with an efficient code review process <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
* Branches, by definition, should only live a few days <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
--
* trunk-based development, where each developer divides their own work into small batches and merges that work into trunk at least once (and potentially several times) a day <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
* The key difference between these approaches is scope <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
* Feature branches typically involve multiple developers and take days or even weeks of work <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
--
* In contrast, branches in trunk-based development typically last no more than a few hours, with many developers merging their individual changes into trunk frequently <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
