### 🔄 Summary Architecture

| **Concept**     | **Dagger**                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DAG**          | Internal representation of all operations and dependencies                 |
| **GraphQL API**  | How your local code communicates with the Dagger engine                    |
| **SDK**          | Thin client that generates and sends GraphQL queries                       |
| **Engine**       | Containerized GraphQL server that builds, runs, and caches workflows       |

### /SUMMARY

✅ Write pipelines as code
✅ Use containers for everything
✅ Run locally, in CI, or on any machine
✅ Test, reuse, share logic
✅ Cross-language support

Dagger is like **Terraform, but for CI/CD** 🎯

### /Final Thoughts
- The initial learning curve can be steep, especially for non-developers like me
- Dagger is a relatively new project that evolves quickly
- Regarding the modules available in the Daggerverse, it can be challenging to judge their quality
- There are no "validated" or "official" modules
